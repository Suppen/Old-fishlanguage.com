This project has been replaced by https://github.com/Suppen/fishlanguage.com

This is the entire source code for the old version of the site fishlanguage.com, which will die in March 2018

It is a [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) project, using Meteor 1.2.1, which requires node 0.10.x to run, meaning the whole thing is ancient.
